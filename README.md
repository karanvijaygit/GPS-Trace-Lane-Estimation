# GPS-Trace-Lane-Estimation
This project deals with solving the problem of identifying number of lanes in a road based on GPS Trace Data of Vehicles.
As the roads may change in width or there is possible change in number of lanes, it is always beneficial to update the maps with such changes.
Instead of using the traditional methods of surveying the location, GPS Trace data of vehicles are being used to update the lane information of roads
Here the GPS trace data of vehicles and roads geometry and direction type - unidirection/bidirection is given and we are supposed to estimate number of lanes.
